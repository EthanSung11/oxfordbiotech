        <h2>What is a ‘Biohackathon’?</h2>
        <p>It will be a weekend of brainstorming and problem-solving to develop a startup pitch for a pressing world problem.
          This may or may not involve computer programming depending on your idea, but there will not be a wet lab component. 
          You'll work as a team, thinking about the technology, IP, and financials of your idea, before preparing a pitch for the judges.</p>

        <h2>Who can get involved?</h2>
        <p>Startup teams work better when they are diverse, and Biotech startups need more than just bioscience expertise to function.
          So if you’re interested in entrepreneurship, business, IP, finance, and/or solving pressing world problems, we’d love to
          have you come along! The Biohackathon is only open to affiliates of the University of Oxford.</p>

        <h2>I have no entrepreneurial/bioscience/IP experience, how will I learn what I need?</h2>
        <p>Diverse teams will have diverse experiences, so if you’re not so sure on one bit, chances are you’ll be able to form a team
           with someone who is. We will also have a team of expert mentors to provide advice in R&D, IP and business development.
           Additionally, we’re going to be running some workshops in advance of the biohackathon to get you clued up, and we’ll also
           highlight all the entrepreneurial workshops going on this term that you can learn from.</p>

        <h2>What’s this year’s theme?</h2>
        <p>We’ll be announcing this soon, so stay tuned!</p>

        <h2>When is it?</h2>
        <p>We’ll have our launch evening on the 1st March, with teams working on their ideas on the 2nd/3rd March over the
          weekend. The top teams will be invited to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges on the evening of Tuesday the 5th March. </p>

        <h2>Where is it?</h2>
        <p>The Biohackathon will be at the Oxford Foundry, with the final pitching competition in the New Biochemistry Seminar Room.
          The workshops in the lead-up will also be in the New Biochemistry Seminar Room. </p>

        <h2>Do I sign up as a team or an individual?</h2>
        <p>Signups will be as individuals, as we want people to go through the whole entrepreneurial process. We’ll have a workshop
          from Entrepreneur First on the 21st February to teach you a process for finding co-founders, and we’ll give you time to
          network with other participants to find your team before the biohackathon starts. </p>

        <h2>I have already developed an idea in the field related to the theme of the Biohackathon, can I present it?</h2>
        <p>The Biohackathon is designed to take you from a problem to a solution, so we think you’ll get more value if you
          come without a well-developed business plan. If you already have an idea, there are lots of other programmes that
          are great to help you develop it. The Oxford Foundry is running their ‘All-Innovate’ competition this term, and
          other organisations such as RebelBio, Imagine IF, and BioStars are all places to help with early-stage
          companies. You can always get in touch with us if you would like advice. </p>

        <h2>Will food be provided?</h2>
        <p>Of course! We’ll be providing food during the Biohackathon for attendees.</p>

        <h2>How do you win?</h2>
        <p>There will be prizes for winning teams, with judging criteria designed to reward teams for exceptional effort
          in different aspects of Biotech. </p>

        <h2>Have another question?</h2>
        <p>Send us an email at info@oxfordbiotech.uk, or message us on Facebook. Make sure you’re signed up to our
          newsletter for updates. </p>
