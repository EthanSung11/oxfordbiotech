        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Oxford University Biotechnology Society was founded with the vision of inspiring students to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in the biotechnology industry. Although the society was only founded in the summer of 2017, significant progress has been made: the society was successfully registered with the university, allowing us to carry the prestigious Oxford University title in our name; the term card for Michaelmas is already full and three speakers have expressed interest in speaking during Hilary term; and contact has been made with a variety of societies inside and outside of Oxford to facilitate membership growth and reach. In the following pages we aim to summarise the state of current work and our vision for expanding the society.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Speaker Events</h2>
        <p>At present, the society aims to attract speakers from the Oxford biotech cluster. In general, we would like to host individual speaker events because many of our speakers are very busy. The types of speakers we are looking to attract fall roughly into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dt>Pharma/biotech entrepreneurs – scientists who have taken intellectual property from the lab to the market</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Pharma/biotech venture capitalists – investors who have nurtured a scientific idea into a company</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Strategists – individuals who understand the direction of innovation and see the big picture</dt>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our first term will consist of four speaker events listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dt>Andrew McLean - Principal at Oxford Science Innovation</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Hagan Bayley - Cofounder of Oxford Nanopore Technologies</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Andrew Wood - Founder of Evox Therapeutics</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Mina Bekheet - Founder and President of Panacea Innovation</dt>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If these events prove to be successful the term card for Hilary term will expand to six or eight speaker events. In the following year, our aim for the society is to expand our reach beyond the Oxford biotech cluster and target scientists, investors and entrepreneurs in the ‘golden triangle’. Following this we hope to attract individuals from European and American biotech companies. Members of the executive committee are in the process of building a network of contacts in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry, which we hope will make the transition beyond Oxford as seamless as possible.</p>

        <h2>Outreach and partnerships</h2>
        <p>To stimulate rapid membership growth the society has formed partnerships with relevant university societies. At present these societies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dt>Oxford Entrepreneurs</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Oxford University Engineering Society</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Oxford University Biological Society</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Oxford Medical Students’ Society</dt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>Capitox (Oxford University Business Careers Society)</dt>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These partnerships will involve the exchange of society term cards and the organisation of more informal networking events. Bringing students together from different academic backgrounds, including scientists and nonscientists, is a central part of our philosophy.</p>
        <p>As well as organising speaker events to inspire our members, we are committed to developing their skills and career aspirations. We aim to achieve this through our collaboration with the Oxford University Careers Service, who have organised a series of biotech and pharma career events for the upcoming year. For Michaelmas term, these include a Science, Engineering and Technology Careers Fair and a Risky Business Workshop run by management consultancy firm Catenion.</p>
        <p>As part of our search for speakers we have gained a unique insight into the structure of the Oxford biotech cluster. This has led us into a partnership with the Harvard University Lab of Entrepreneurship and Development (LEAD), which analyses centres of innovation to better recognise, understand and create opportunities. This partnership will give us access to the expertise to aid in the development of the Oxford biotech cluster.</p>

        <h2>Membership</h2>
        <p>With sponsorship we hope to quickly grow our membership base by making membership free. Other similar societies such as the Oxford Guild and Oxford Entrepreneurs use this model with great success. Open access talks will be open to non-members as well as members, however people will be able to become members of the society in order to subscribe to our mailing list and be eligible to attend balloted and application-only events.</p>

        <h2>2017/2018 Budget Proposal</h2>
        <p>The majority of proposed expenditure for the club would be on event catering and speaker hosting, with a smaller proportion allocated to marketing the club to potential new members. Many societies in Oxford use social events as a way of recruiting new members, including those who might not normally have been interested in their events. One example of this is the Oxford Law Society, which runs many events hosted by law firms, and events are attended by students across the range of subjects at the university. Attendance to these can be drop-in, balloted, or by application, thus ensuring that the sponsor fulfills their objectives for the event.</p>
        <p>A rough breakdown of expected costs for the forthcoming academic year follows:</p>

        
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Stash</td>
            <td>£80</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Freshers’ Fair Table</td>
            <td>£90</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Advertising Material e.g. roller banner, posters, flyers, business cards</td>
            <td>£160</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Term Cards</td>
            <td>£25</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Total</th>
            <th>£355</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Events</h3>
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Drinks Reception</td>
            <td>For guests to meet the speaker and socialise after events, with wine and nibbles. Assuming 50 guests per event.</td>
            <td>£70 per event</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Speaker Hosting</td>
            <td>We will offer a unique experience for visiting speakers, by treating them to dinner at a college ‘Formal Hall’. Assuming dinner for 4</td>
            <td>£60 per event</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Total</th>
            <th>Assuming 10 events</th>
            <th>£1300</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>Total projected expenditure is therefore in the region of £1655.</p>

        <h2>Opportunities for Merck</h2>
        <p>We envisage a partnership which allows the society to grow to its full potential with not just financial support, but a flow of discussion between the company and the members of our society. Our members gain an insight into the workings of one of the largest and most prestigious pharmaceutical companies in the world, and the company expands its recruiting opportunities in one of the most employable student bodies in the world.</p>
        <p>The opportunities for Merck are not limited to those which we have proposed on our website, and we welcome a discussion to ensure that the company can fulfill its aims when leveraging any sponsorship arrangement.</p>
        <p>As a major sponsor of the society, Merck could be present front-and-centre on all of our promotional and informational material. There could be a dedicated page on the website, along with branding on our leaflets, banners, posters, etc.</p>
        <p>The society is, however, all about events, and bringing people together, and therefore we are excited about the opportunities for interaction between our members and the company. Below, we have listed two possible types of event that Merck may want to hold:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dt>A panel discussion, followed by drinks</dt>
            <dd>This could be an open event with multiple speakers from Merck, from different sectors, who discuss life within the company. Followed by a Q and A and then an informal drinks reception afterwards where the members of the society could discuss further with the panel speakers.</dd>
          </li>
          <li>
            <dt>A dinner for students with a representative from Merck</dt>
            <dd>This could be an event where members of the society can apply to have dinner with a representative of the company to discuss whether they would like to apply to work for the company, and the opportunities the company can offer to them for employment.</dd>
          </li>
        </ul>
